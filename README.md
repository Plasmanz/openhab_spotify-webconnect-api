# openhab_spotify-webconnect-api
A simple Python script to integrate Spotify's Web Connect API (https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/web-api-connect-endpoint-reference/) to OpenHab (openhab.org)

<h1>Prerequisite</h1>

* OpenHab 2.1 installed on Raspberry Pi (or similar)
* OpenHab REST installed
* Spotify User Account
* Spotify Developer Account
* Know your OpenHab root URL/IP and port. In this doc, I assume http://openhabianpi.local:8080/

<h1>Instructions</h1>

1. Add the spotify.items file into openhab-conf/items and verify they have been added to your setup in Paper UI

* Check by asking the rest API: http://openhabianpi.local:8080/rest/items/spotify_auth_code
* You should get a successful JSON response

2. Place the following files in the folders:

* theme.css into openhab-conf/html
* tvAppIcons.svg into openhab-conf/html
* spotify-auth.html into openhab-conf/html
* myopenhab.py into openhab-conf/scripts
* spotify.py into openhab-conf/scripts
* spotify.rules into openhab-conf/rules

3. Verify you can reach spotify-auth.html

* Go to: http://openhabianpi.local:8080/static/spotify-auth.html
* You should see a page called "Spotify Integration" with a status message "spotify_client_id" missing

4. After registering as a Spotify developer, create a new App and retrieve client id and secret:

* Goto https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications
* Click "Create App"
* Provide a name and description
* Set the Redirect URI to:  http://openhabianpi.local:8080/static/spotify-auth.html
* Save the Settings

5. Give the client id and secret to OpenHab

* Save the Client ID to spotify_client_id in OpenHab
* Copy the Client Secret to spotify_client_secret in OpenHab

6. Authenticate your New App for your Spotify User

* Go to: http://openhabianpi.local:8080/static/spotify-auth.html
* You should see a page called "Spotify Integration" with a status message "Click here to Authenticate"
* Click the link and authenticate your app
* When done, the page returns and displays "New Auth Code successfully saved to OpenHab!"
* Check that the spotify_auth_code is set in OpenHab

7. Test spotify.py in SSH

/usr/bin/python /etc/openhab2/scripts/spotify.py

You should see this:

```python
Successfully got state from OpenHab: spotify_client_id
Successfully got state from OpenHab: spotify_client_secret
Successfully got state from OpenHab: spotify_access_token
Successfully got state from OpenHab: spotify_refresh_token

Successfully posted state to OpenHab: spotify_current_device_id
 -> Success
Successfully posted state to OpenHab: spotify_lastConnectionDateTime
Done in 0.761183977127 seconds
```

8. You can now hook up OpenHab rules or HabPanel with the data in the spotify items.
